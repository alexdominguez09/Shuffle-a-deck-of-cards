# Shuffle-a-deck-of-cards
This is a C portable program to simulate shuffling a deck of cards as many times as the final result would be the deck of carts totally well sorted.

The programme has ben compiled and ported into 2 diferent plataforms so far:

Linux -> CPU i5-5200U -> Linux ubuntu 4.15.0-128-generic #131~16.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Wed Dec 9 17:33:47 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
      -> Compiled with code::blocks usin gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.12)
      -> Run in single core -> Speed: 6056856 shuffles per second.
      
MS-DOS -> CPU 80286 -> MS-DOS 6.22
       -> Compiled in Turbo C++ 1.01
       -> Run in single core -> Speed: 743 shuffles per second.
       
       
       
The reason to write it in C and in a single file was to be able to port it into as many plataforms posible and to make a easy and portable as possible
